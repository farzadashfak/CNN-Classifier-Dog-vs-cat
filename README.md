# CNN-Classifier-Dog-vs-cat

## Overview ##
In this project, I used Deep Learning (Tensorflow, Keras) and Convolutional Neural Networks to create a binary classification model based on Computer Vision. I performed data augmentation and created tensors with a dataset of 26000 images of dogs and cats (from Kaggle) and achieved a 96.2% accuracy rate with ReLU Activation and Binary Cross Loss Function. 

## Convolutional Neural Networks ##
A convolutional neural network (CNN or ConvNet), is a network architecture for deep learning which learns directly from data, eliminating the need for manual feature extraction. These neural networks are primarily used in Computer Vision.

## Binary Cross Entropy Loss ##
Binary crossentropy is a loss function that is used in binary classification tasks. These are tasks that answer a question with only two choices (yes or no, A or B, 0 or 1, left or right).
